For run test you should to import test.jmx file in Apache JMeter (http://jmeter.apache.org/)
Then you should to create in studio 2 tenants -> "demo" and "test" and in "demo" you should
to create 3 users -> "admin1", "admin2" and "admin3".

So in result you should to have following:

demo -> admin
     -> admin1
     -> admin2
     -> admin3

test -> admin


And then you should to run studio and run testPlan in Apache JMeter.
